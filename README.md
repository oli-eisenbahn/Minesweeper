# Minesweeper
A simplistic take on the classic game of Minesweeper, equipped with a multitude of additional features:

Board Editor:
A toggleable editor option allows boards to be altered freely. This enables the user to create fun and challenging custom boards.

Save Slots:
Along with the editor comes a tab with save slots to allow the user to save their creations. Boards can then be loaded from the slots.

Board Sharing:
In the save slot menu, the user is also given the option to copy a save slot to the clipboard, which encrypts the board as a string of characters. If the user has one of these strings on their clipboard, they are able to paste it into any save slots. This allows easy sharing of custom boards between users.
